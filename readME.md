## Simple words :


- The document talks about using a smart system to find racist comments in social media posts automatically. It uses a special combined model to understand the feelings in these posts. This model is very good at spotting racist content in tweets. It works better than older methods and can adapt to new types of racism. The study shows that this model is accurate and can handle a lot of posts quickly. In the future, they want to make it even better by using advanced technology to understand different languages and respond faster to posts.

# What are the algorithms which are used in this ?

### The document mentions the following algorithms used in the proposed system for detecting racism on social media through sentiment analysis with a stacked ensemble model:

- Gated Recurrent Units (GRU): GRU helps the system understand the order of words in a sentence. It remembers important words that came before to make sense of the whole sentence.

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): CNN looks at different parts of a sentence at once to find important patterns. It helps the system recognize key features in the text.

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): RNN helps the system understand the context of words in a sentence. It looks at how words relate to each other to make accurate predictions about the meaning of the text.

# What is Sentiment Analysis ?

- Sentiment analysis is a method that involves analyzing text to determine the emotions or opinions expressed within it. It helps in understanding the sentiment behind the words used in a piece of writing, such as whether the text conveys positivity, negativity, or neutrality. This analysis can be applied to various forms of text, including social media posts like tweets, to automatically detect the underlying sentiment. By utilizing advanced models like the stacked ensemble approach, sentiment analysis can be automated and enhanced for accurate interpretation of language nuances. These models, such as the GCR-NN, combine different techniques to improve the detection of sentiments, particularly in identifying racist content in social media posts. Through the use of deep learning and machine learning algorithms, sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in analyzing and interpreting the sentiments expressed in text data.

- Sentiment analysis is like teaching a computer to understand feelings in text. It helps the computer figure out if a piece of writing is positive, negative, or neutral. By analyzing the words and phrases used, sentiment analysis can tell if someone is happy, sad, angry, or just sharing information without any strong emotion. It's like giving the computer the ability to understand the mood or tone of what people are saying in their writing.

# What is Racism ?

` Racism is a belief or behavior that treats people unfairly or discriminates against them based on their race or ethnicity. It involves prejudice, stereotypes, or negative attitudes towards individuals or groups because of their racial background. Racism can manifest in various forms, such as verbal insults, discriminatory actions, unequal treatment, or systemic biases that disadvantage certain racial or ethnic groups. It is a harmful and unjust practice that undermines equality and can have serious social, economic, and psychological impacts on individuals and communities.

# What is Stacked Ensemble GCR-NN model ?

- The Stacked Ensemble GCR-NN model is a sophisticated approach that combines different deep learning components to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of sentiment analysis, particularly in detecting racist content in social media posts. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the model represents:

- 1. Stacked Ensemble: This refers to a technique where multiple machine learning models are combined to improve overall performance. In this case, various deep learning components are stacked together to create a more powerful and accurate model.

- 2. GCR-NN:

  - GRU (Gated Recurrent Units): GRU is a type of neural network that helps capture sequential dependencies in data, making it useful for understanding the order of words in a sentence.
  - CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): CNN is adept at extracting spatial features from data, which in this context helps identify important patterns in text.
  - RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks): RNN is effective at analyzing contextual information by considering the relationship between words in a sentence.
By combining these components in a stacked ensemble fashion, the GCR-NN model can better understand the sentiment and context of text, leading to improved detection of racist content in social media posts. The model's strength lies in its ability to leverage the unique capabilities of each component to achieve high accuracy and nuanced analysis of language patterns related to racism.


- In simpler terms, the Stacked Ensemble GCR-NN model is like a smart system that combines different ways of understanding text to figure out if there are any racist comments in social media posts. It's kind of like having multiple experts working together to catch any negative or discriminatory language in tweets automatically. By using this advanced model, the system can quickly analyze the feelings behind the words used in posts and accurately detect any racist content.

# How this project is different from existing project ?
