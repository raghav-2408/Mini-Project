# Racism Detection by Analyzing Differential Opinions Through Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Using Stacked Ensemble GCR-NN Model

#### The document discusses the utilization of advanced sentiment analysis to detect racist content in tweets on social media. It introduces a sophisticated ensemble model, the GCR-NN, which combines various deep learning components for accurate sentiment analysis. The study emphasizes the need for automated detection of racism on social media platforms like Twitter. By employing a stacked ensemble approach, the model achieves high accuracy in identifying racist tweets, outperforming traditional machine learning methods. The results showcase the effectiveness of the model in detecting both explicit and implicit forms of racism, highlighting its scalability and adaptability to evolving expressions of racism. Additionally, the document suggests future enhancements such as integrating Transformer-based models for improved language interpretation and expanding detection capabilities to multiple languages for broader applicability


## Simple words :


#### The document talks about using a smart system to find racist comments in social media posts automatically. It uses a special combined model to understand the feelings in these posts. This model is very good at spotting racist content in tweets. It works better than older methods and can adapt to new types of racism. The study shows that this model is accurate and can handle a lot of posts quickly. In the future, they want to make it even better by using advanced technology to understand different languages and respond faster to posts.

# What are the algorithms which are used in this ?

### The document mentions the following algorithms used in the proposed system for detecting racism on social media through sentiment analysis with a stacked ensemble model:

- Gated Recurrent Units (GRU): Used for capturing sequential text dependencies.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Employed for extracting spatial text features.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Utilized for analyzing contextual information.
- These algorithms are combined in the stacked ensemble GCR-NN model to enhance context understanding and accuracy in detecting racist content in social media posts.
