# Racism Detection by Analyzing Differential Opinions Through Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Using Stacked Ensemble GCR-NN Model

#### The document discusses the utilization of advanced sentiment analysis to detect racist content in tweets on social media. It introduces a sophisticated ensemble model, the GCR-NN, which combines various deep learning components for accurate sentiment analysis. The study emphasizes the need for automated detection of racism on social media platforms like Twitter. By employing a stacked ensemble approach, the model achieves high accuracy in identifying racist tweets, outperforming traditional machine learning methods. The results showcase the effectiveness of the model in detecting both explicit and implicit forms of racism, highlighting its scalability and adaptability to evolving expressions of racism. Additionally, the document suggests future enhancements such as integrating Transformer-based models for improved language interpretation and expanding detection capabilities to multiple languages for broader applicability
