# Racism Detection by Analyzing Differential Opinions Through Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Using Stacked Ensemble GCR-NN Model

- The document discusses the utilization of advanced sentiment analysis to detect racist content in tweets on social media. It introduces a sophisticated ensemble model, the GCR-NN, which combines various deep learning components for accurate sentiment analysis. The study emphasizes the need for automated detection of racism on social media platforms like Twitter. By employing a stacked ensemble approach, the model achieves high accuracy in identifying racist tweets, outperforming traditional machine learning methods. The results showcase the effectiveness of the model in detecting both explicit and implicit forms of racism, highlighting its scalability and adaptability to evolving expressions of racism. Additionally, the document suggests future enhancements such as integrating Transformer-based models for improved language interpretation and expanding detection capabilities to multiple languages for broader applicability


## Simple words :


- The document talks about using a smart system to find racist comments in social media posts automatically. It uses a special combined model to understand the feelings in these posts. This model is very good at spotting racist content in tweets. It works better than older methods and can adapt to new types of racism. The study shows that this model is accurate and can handle a lot of posts quickly. In the future, they want to make it even better by using advanced technology to understand different languages and respond faster to posts.

# What are the algorithms which are used in this ?

### The document mentions the following algorithms used in the proposed system for detecting racism on social media through sentiment analysis with a stacked ensemble model:

- Gated Recurrent Units (GRU): GRU helps the system understand the order of words in a sentence. It remembers important words that came before to make sense of the whole sentence.

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): CNN looks at different parts of a sentence at once to find important patterns. It helps the system recognize key features in the text.

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): RNN helps the system understand the context of words in a sentence. It looks at how words relate to each other to make accurate predictions about the meaning of the text.

# What is Sentiment Analysis ?

- Sentiment analysis is a method that involves analyzing text to determine the emotions or opinions expressed within it. It helps in understanding the sentiment behind the words used in a piece of writing, such as whether the text conveys positivity, negativity, or neutrality. This analysis can be applied to various forms of text, including social media posts like tweets, to automatically detect the underlying sentiment. By utilizing advanced models like the stacked ensemble approach, sentiment analysis can be automated and enhanced for accurate interpretation of language nuances. These models, such as the GCR-NN, combine different techniques to improve the detection of sentiments, particularly in identifying racist content in social media posts. Through the use of deep learning and machine learning algorithms, sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in analyzing and interpreting the sentiments expressed in text data.

- Sentiment analysis is like teaching a computer to understand feelings in text. It helps the computer figure out if a piece of writing is positive, negative, or neutral. By analyzing the words and phrases used, sentiment analysis can tell if someone is happy, sad, angry, or just sharing information without any strong emotion. It's like giving the computer the ability to understand the mood or tone of what people are saying in their writing.
